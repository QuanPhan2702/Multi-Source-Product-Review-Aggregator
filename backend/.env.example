# Example environment variables for the backend
# Normally, this file is NOT needed in production since env vars are set in the deployment
# during development, the default values should work fine.

# Copy this file to .env and customize the values as needed
# Do NOT commit your actual .env file with real secrets to version control

# These should match the MySQL settings in docker-compose.yml
